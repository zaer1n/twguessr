## üìå Info
- This is a discord bot for playing guessing game with teeworlds maps.
- Maps released from both kog and ddnet are supported. Players can choose between the two map pools.
- The code is probably very poor and crappy as I'm still learning Rust.

## üé≤ Game Rules
- Fastest user to send the map name (case insensitive) wins.
- There is a 90 second time limit.
- The answer can be revealed without waiting by skipping.
- Players can take the following hints in order: map rating, map creator and first letter of the answer.
